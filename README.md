# CUPI
CUPI: Asistente conversacional is a mobile application that helps you get out of the struggle that is online flirting.

It's very simple to use, you simply take a screenshot of a chat, instagram story or tinder profile and the app will generate a custom response for you to succeed. 

Simple landing page that gives the user links to the mobile stores: https://www.chatcupi.com/

Both IOS and Android link for a direct download: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cupi/id6754704077 and https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.utopic_innovations.cupi

Technically speaking this project was not so challening, but creating and promoting the application on social media was definetly a struggle. 

Metrics of the project:
1000+ created users
1500+ generated responses
20+ paid suscriptions
2% conversion rate
80%+ churn

Conclusions:
Project was abandoned because the churn was huge, however the conversion rate was not so bad. This means that the problem is real, in the sense that users are willing to pay for it, but the implemented solution did not meet the expectations for it. One could definitely engineer a better solution that the one implemented in this project, but I am not sure whether it would be enough for the final user. That is because the problem of getting the "vibe" of a conversation is heavily context-based and also it's imposible by asking some initial general questions to get the personality of the user sufficiently good enough so that the generated responses feel familiar for him/her. All in all it was a good experience, and for future reference the value of generating very basic content online has huge impact on the success of an app.
